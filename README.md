# Data Preprocessing with Iris Dataset

Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Assignment Description
This Assignment 2 performs data preprocessing on the Iris dataset, focusing on:

- Min-Max Normalization
- Z-score Standardization
- Visualization of feature distributions
- Training Logistic Regression models before and after scaling
- Comparing model accuracies

## To Run
1. Running the Python script. 
2. Outputs include printed transformed data, accuracy scores, and distribution histograms.
3. Requires `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

## Explanation
- Normalization scales features between 0 and 1, helpful for algorithms sensitive to feature range.
- Standardization centers data around zero mean and unit variance, preferred for many ML algorithms.
- The script demonstrates the impact of these techniques on Logistic Regression accuracy.
